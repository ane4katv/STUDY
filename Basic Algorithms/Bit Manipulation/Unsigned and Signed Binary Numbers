Unsigned Numbers
----------------
 can be only positive
 Representation  of Unsigned Binanry Numbers:
 Every number in unsigned number representation
 has only one unique binary equivalent form,
 so this is unambiguous representation technique.
 The range of unsigned binary number is from  0 to (2n-1).

Signed Numbers:
----------------
- can be negative or positive
- count only half as far, but in both directions (- and +)

Signed numbers contain sign flag,
this representation distinguish positive and negative numbers.
For example, in representation of negative decimal numbers,
we need to put negative symbol in front of given decimal number.

Signed Representation Forms:
1. Sign-Magnitude
    For n bit binary number, 1 bit is reserved for sign symbol
    If the value of sign bit is 0, then the given number will be positive,
    else if the value of sign bit is 1, then the given number will be negative.
2. 1's Compliment
    Obtained by inverting each bit of given number.
    we represent positive numbers in binary form
    and negative numbers in 1’s complement form
    There is extra bit for sign representation
3. 2's Compliment
    obtained by inverting each bit of given number plus 1
    to least significant bit (LSB)
    we represent positive numbers in binary form
    and negative numbers in 2’s complement form
    There is extra bit for sign representation
==============================================
Number can look the same:
1010
signed: -2
unsigned: 10

Python doesn't have builtin unsigned types
