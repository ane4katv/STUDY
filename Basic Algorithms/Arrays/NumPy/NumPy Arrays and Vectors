NumPy is is a library for Python.
It adds support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices,
 along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays

NumPy library provides you with an array data structure
that holds some benefits over Python lists:
- being more compact, f
- faster access in reading and writing items,
- being more convenient,
- more efficient

NumPy array is a central data structure of the numpy library

Vectors, Matrices, and Arrays

Vectors. Math is fun.

Numpy for matrices and vectors
http://www2.lawrence.edu/fast/GREGGJ/Python/numpy/numpyLA.html

The numpy ndarray class is used to represent both matrices and vectors.
To construct a matrix in numpy we list the rows of the matrix in a list
and pass that list to the numpy array constructor.


A = np.array([[1,-1,2],[3,2,0]])

Vectors are just arrays with a single column. For example, to construct a vector

v = np.array([[2],[1],[3]])

A more convenient approach is to transpose the corresponding row vector.
For example, to make the vector above we could instead transpose the row vector

v = np.transpose(np.array([[2,1,3]]))
