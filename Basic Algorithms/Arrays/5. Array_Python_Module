When to use arrays?

Lists are much more flexible than arrays.
They can store elements of different data types including strings.
If you need to do mathematical computation on arrays and matrices,
you are much better off using something like NumPy library.

So, what are the uses of arrays created from the Python array module?

The array.array type is just a thin wrapper on C arrays which provides space-efficient storage
 of basic C-style data types. If you need to allocate an array that you KNOW will not change,
 then arrays can be faster and use less memory than normal lists.

Unless you don't really need arrays (array module may be needed to interface with C code),
their use is not highly recommended.
